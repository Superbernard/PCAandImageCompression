# PCAandImageCompression
Image compression and reconstruction via principal component analysis


This is a course project I did in Math5793 Advanced Applied Statistics. PCA was used to conduct image (array) compression.

The PCA_ImageCompression.pdf file is a brief report of the practice with plots and results.

The grayScale_jpg_image_compression_PCA.R and RGB_jpg_imageCompression_PCA.R are two R files that contain all the R codes used in the project. The former focuses on compression on grayscale jpg images and the latter explores compression on three channel RGB images.

The 3 jpg picture files ou1.jpg, ou2.jpg, thunder.jpg are example images used in the project.
